# BBEdit - It Doesn't Suck 

Installs [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

Does not include license but there is a free alternative Textwrangler. 

## Usage:

``` puppet
include bbedit
```

**Note**: Right now this does not install cmd tools so you will have to run that from the app menu on your own.
